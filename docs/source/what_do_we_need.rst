1. What Else Should You Prepare?
===================================

To get started with your Pironman series product, you'll need to gather a few essential components and some optional extras depending on your project requirements.

**Essential Components**

* **Raspberry Pi 5** 

  The Pironman 5 series is fully compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5. Ensure you have this board to use with your case.

* **5V/5A Power Adapter**

  A 5V/5A power adapter is necessary to power the Pironman 5 and its integrated components.

* **Micro SD Card**
 
  For Raspberry Pi OS, we recommend an SD card with a minimum of 16GB storage. If you plan to use Raspberry Pi OS Lite, a minimum of 4GB storage is sufficient.

**Optional Components**

* **M.2 NVMe SSD**
 
  The Pironman 5 series features an NVMe slot with an M.2 SSD connector, supporting four sizes of NVMe M.2 SSDs: 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280. The slot is certified for Gen 2.0 speeds (5 GT/sec) and can be configured to Gen 3.0 (10 GT/sec) for enhanced performance.

* **Screen**

  To access the Raspberry Pi's desktop environment, you'll need a display such as a TV or computer monitor. 

* **HDMI Cable**

  * **Pironman 5**: Equipped with standard HDMI Type A ports, requiring a standard HDMI to HDMI cable.  
  * **Pironman 5 Mini**: Features micro HDMI ports, so a micro HDMI to HDMI cable is needed for connection.

* **Mouse & Keyboard**

  You can connect a wired mouse and keyboard or a wireless setup via a USB Bluetooth receiver to any USB port on the Pironman 5.

By ensuring you have these components ready, you'll be fully equipped to set up and enjoy your Pironman case with your Raspberry Pi 5!
