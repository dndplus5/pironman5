4. Set Up or Install Software
================================================

After installing the operating system onto your Micro SD card or NVMe SSD, insert it into your Pironman 5. Press the power button to turn on the device.

At this stage, you will notice that the power LEDs are lit, but certain features of the Pironman 5, such as the OLED display, RGB LEDs, and side-mounted RGB fan(s), will not be operational yet. This is because they require configuration through the ``pironman5.service``, which identifies and enables the specific features of your Pironman series product.

If you encounter screen garbling issues, you can ignore them for now, as they will be resolved after completing the configuration process.

To begin the configuration, you first need to boot and log into your Raspberry Pi. If you're unsure how to log in, visit the official Raspberry Pi website: |link_rpi_get_start|.

Once logged in, follow the configuration tutorial for your chosen system:

**About Power Button**

The power button brings out the power button of the Raspberry Pi 5, and it functions just like the power button of the Raspberry Pi 5.

* **Shutdown**

    * If you run Raspberry Pi **Bookworm Desktop** system, you can press the power button twice in quick succession to shutdown. 
    * If you run Raspberry Pi **Bookworm Lite** system, press the power button a single time to initiate a shutdown.
    * To force a hard shutdown, press and hold the power button.

* **Power on**

    * If the Raspberry Pi board is shut down, but still powered, single-press to power on from a shutdown state.

* If you are running a system that does not support a shutdown button, you can hold it for 5 seconds to force a hard shutdown, and single-press to power on from a shutdown state.
